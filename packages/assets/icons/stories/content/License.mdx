	<p>New icons need to be added to SUI Icons Pack first. Please, visit the <LinkTo kind="sui-support--page">Support</LinkTo> page for more information on how to request it.</p>
	<p>We can usually add an icon and release a new version on the same day if there is a hurry. However, remember that if there's a similar icon already available, we suggest you use it instead unless you request a design update.</p>
