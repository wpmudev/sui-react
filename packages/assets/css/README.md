# **Shared UI CSS Framework**

WPMU DEV's Shared UI CSS Framework includes a wide range of shorthand utility classes to modify an element's appearance in a plugin.

This framework's primary goal is to deliver a method of styling elements with as little friction as possible. Our framework allows us to use our Design Tokens via memorable CSS-based utility classes.
