	<p>
		Column classes organize the columns out of the amount you need per row
		based on the twelve-column grid size; this means if you need to display
		three equal-width columns, you must divide the size of the grid by the
		number of columns, which in this case, is twelve. The result you get is
		the column size.
	</p>
	<p>
		By default, the columns align equally in size to occupy the entire row
		width in case alignment is inline, but if that is not the case, then the
		columns will properly align one below each other in stacked mode.
	</p>
	<p>
		Enable column styles; for that, use the class name as in the sample code
		below:
	</p>
	<Snippet language="html">{codeCol}</Snippet>
	<p>Remember, columns must go inside a row to work correctly.</p>
</Section>

<Section title="Modifiers" contained={true}>
	<p>
		When columns are inline aligned, you can use the modifier class to
		specify the column size in a twelve-grid row instead of leaving it for
		auto-sizing. These modifiers won't affect when the row aligns columns in
		stacked mode.
	</p>
	<p>
		Enable column sizing; for that, use the class name as in the sample code
		below, being <Code>$size</Code> a number between 1 to 12:
	</p>
	<Snippet language="html">{codesize}</Snippet>
	<p>
		Remember, the column's size sum must be at most 12, the limit of columns
		allowed per row.
