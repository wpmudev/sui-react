				Shared UI aims to improve WPMU DEV's products' UI consistency and quality while making our design and development processes more efficient. Shared UI also helps establish a common vocabulary between everyone in our organization and eases collaboration between different teams and disciplines.
			</p>
			{/*<p>
				The Shared UI has a core team of designers and developers inside WPMU DEV who are committed to building and supporting the system. The core team includes <a href="https://wpmudev.com/profile/shia/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Leighton Sapir</a>, <a href="https://wpmudev.com/profile/atandilyan/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Ani Tandilyan</a>, <a href="https://wpmudev.com/profile/nilanbhasima/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Nilan Bhasima</a>, <a href="https://wpmudev.com/profile/Afia%20Udofia/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Afia Udofia</a>, and <a href="https://wpmudev.com/profile/pawankumar69512/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Pawan Kumar</a>.

				Our public documentation makes sharing and collaboration between different teams easier while, at the same time, it increases the system's visibility and accountability. It also helps us push towards higher quality and be more transparent. At last, it also works as a fantastic tool we can leverage in recruiting.

			title="Installing Shared UI"
		>
			<p>
				To get all the components packages, run the following command:
				```
					npm install @wpmudev/sui-react
				```
				When you install this package, additional packages will also be installed.
				<List>
					<span label="@wpmudev/sui-hooks" />
					<span label="@wpmudev/sui-utils" />
				</List>
				
				You will also need to install `sui-css` and `sui-icons` packages: 
				```
                    npm install @wpmudev/sui-css @wpmudev/sui-icons
				``` 

				Finally, make sure to import the styles in your app, you can add this line to your top-most component in your application: 
				```
					import '@wpmudev/sui-css/dist/css/sui-css.min.css'
				```

				#### Important Note
				After installing the package, you might be tempted to import the components directly from the `sui-react` package. for example you might do something like:
				```
					import { Button, BasicBox } from '@wpmudev/sui-react'
				```
				
				 However, we recommend importing the components from their packages instead. This way, it can be easier to update the components packages individually whenever new versions are needed. 
				 the correct way to import the components would be:

				 ```
				 	import { Button } from '@wpmudev/sui-button'
				import { BasicBox } from '@wpmudev/sui-basic-box'
				 ```
